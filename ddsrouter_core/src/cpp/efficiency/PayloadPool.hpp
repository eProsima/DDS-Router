 * Pool to store and release payloads.
 *
 * A Payload is an object with a blind pointer to a string of bytes and extra info (size, length, etc.).
 * Ideally, any payload data will be copied just once, and move the reference from one element to another.
 * When a payload data has not more references to it, it will be erased.
 *
 * This Pool will be called to store a new message that a Reader receives (ideally it will be called just one
 * per message received).
 * Then, this payload will be moved to the Track. As the payload is already in the pool, there will be no copy.
 * Finally, the payload will be moved to every Writer that has to send the data (ideally without copy).
