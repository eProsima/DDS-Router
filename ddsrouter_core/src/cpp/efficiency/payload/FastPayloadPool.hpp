/**
 * This class implements the interface of PayloadPool and fulfilled with it the interface of IPayloadPool from
 * eProsima Fast DDS.
 *
 * This class is used to manage the allocation and release of the payloads used within the Router.
 * The main target is not to copy or alloc data that is already in memory, but to reuse it safely.
 *
 * This implementation uses an idea get from TopicPayloadPool from fastrtps.
 * This is, to alloc more space than required whenever a new payload is needed, and in this extra space (at the
 * beginning of the data) stores the number of references this data has.
 * As long as this number does not reach 0, the data is not deleted.
 *
 * This is a thread safe lock free (except for one atomic check) implementation.
 *
 * @warning this class requires for all the payloads to be released the same times they are retrieved.
 * In case this does not occur, this object does not guarantee that the data will be correctly released.
 *
 * @warning Payloads used within this class must be allocated from this object (in case of \c get_payload it is enough
 * to use the correct \c data_owner as not this one. ) otherwise it will head to undefined behavior.
