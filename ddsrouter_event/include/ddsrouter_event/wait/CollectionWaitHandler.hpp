 * \c CollectionWaitHandler is a class to implement a Wait Handler that store data in a collection and allow
 * to threads to wait until some data is inserted, and remove it from the collection.
 * The typicall use will be to implement this class with an internal queue or stack to store sorted data and
 * consume this data from threads that may wait for a data to be available.
 *
 * \c T specializes this class depending on the data that is stored inside the collection.
 *
 * This class uses an internal CounterWaitHandler to count the number of data stored in the collection.
 *
 * WARNING: This class does not protect the internal collection. Making it thread safe is users duty.
 * WARNING: The collection must be inside this handler object and should not be accessed outside this class methods.
