/**
 * @brief These classes implement a new smart pointer that allows to reference data with only one ownership
 * from different scopes and threads.
 *
 * INSTRUCTIONS
 * The correct way of using it is having a \c OwnerPtr object referencing the data, and getting
 * a lessee from it.
 * Before using the data in the ptr, use \c lock and check the result is not null.
 * Destroy the ptr after using it. It is advisable to destroy it soon, as the owner could want to erase it.
 *
 * USE CASE
 * Whenever an object must be created and deleted from a single point, but could be used from different
 * scopes and/or threads.
 *
 * WHY NEW CLASS
 * It is similar to a shared_ptr and weak_ptr, but this assures the object is only destroyed from its
 * owner, and only if no lessee is using it at the moment.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION
 * The way it works, is that every \c OwnerPtr shares a mutex with every \c LesseePtr , so while the
 * data is being used by a lessee, the owner cannot destroy it.
 * Whenever the object is used from a lessee, a new ptr is created and the mutex locked. When this ptr is deleted
 * the mutex is unlocked (by unique_ptr deleter).
 *
 *
 * EXAMPLE OF USAGE
 * OwnerPtr<T> owner(new T());
 * LesseePtr<T> lessee = owner.lease();
 * {
 *   auto locked_ptr_ = lessee.lock(); // From here till locked_ptr_ destruction, data could not be destroyed.
 *   if (locked_ptr_) {
 *     locked_ptr_->foo(); // Use data without worrying it could be destroyed
 *   } else {
 *     // Ups, the data is not available anymore
 *   }
 * }
 */

/**
 * This class contains a reference (ptr) to a value of type T but does not own it.
 * Not owning the object implies that, when being used, this reference could have been invalidated.
 * In order to avoid that, method \c lock creates a smart pointer referencing that object, that will not be destroyed
 * while the smart pointer exists.
 *
 * @tparam T Type of the data referenced by this ptr.
 *
 * @note It could only be created from a \c OwnerPtr object, the owner of the data referenced.
