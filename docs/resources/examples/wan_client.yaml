# CONFIGURATION DESCRIPTION

# This configuration example configures a DDS Router to listen to every message published in domain 1 in topics
# HelloWorldTopic (from Fast DDS HelloWorld) and rt/chatter from ROS2 demo_nodes, and to transmit these messages
# through a WAN Participant (configured as Client) to another WAN Participant.
# The other direction of communication is also possible; receive messages at the WAN Participant and locally
# publish them in domain 1.
# Client specifies which DDS Router starts the communication with the other, and after communication has been
# established, both routers behave in the same way.

# 0: Use YAML configuration version v3.0

# 1: Allow DDS Topic Name <HelloWorldTopic> with type <HelloWorld>.

# 2: Insert new topics in order to route them.

# 3: New Participant with name <SimpleParticipant>.

# 4: Kind of SimpleParticipant: <local>.
# LAN UDP communication with default simple multicast discovery.

# 5: SimpleParticipant will use DDS Domain ID <1>.

# 6: New Participant with name <WANClient>.

# 7: Kind of WANClient: <wan>.
# WAN communication with another DDS Router.

# 8: Add the addresses where to reach the remote DDS Routers that will connect to.
# Add as many connection-addresses as needed.

# 9: Connect to a WAN Participant in IP <1.1.1.1> listening in port 11666 over UDP transport (default).
# This is the same configuration that must be set in the DDS Router that works as a Server in its listening-addresses.
# Add every other address where trying to reach this same remote WAN Server.

# 10: Add the interfaces where this Participant will listen in WAN.
# This is only needed if Remote WAN Server is using only UDP.
# Add as many listening-addresses as needed.

# 11: Listen in public IP (2.2.2.2) for remote traffic.
# This IP must be set to the public IP of the host where this DDS Router will run.

# 12: Listening port is 11670.
# Remember that if the host is under a NAT, the IP must be the public one and must be forwarded from network
# router to this host to the same port.

# 13: It uses UDP transport by default if not set. Could be set to "udp" or "tcp".
