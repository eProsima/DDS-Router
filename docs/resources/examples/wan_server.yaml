# CONFIGURATION DESCRIPTION

# With this example, a DDS Router subscribes to every topic in allowlist and transmit this data through
# WAN connection to another DDS Router.
# It will also publish locally the data received from the remote DDS Router.
# Server specifies that this DDS Router will be communicated from remote DDS Routers for the first time.
# Once the communication has been established the behavior of each of the routers do not change.

# 1: Allow DDS Topic Name <HelloWorldTopic> with type <HelloWorld>.

# 2: Insert new topics in order to route them.

# 3: New Participant with name <SimpleParticipant>.

# 4: Type of SimpleParticipant: <local>.
# LAN UDP communication with default simple multicast discovery.

# 5: SimpleParticipant will use DDS Domain ID <0>.

# 6: New Participant with name <WANServer>.

# 7: Type of WANServer: <wan>.
# WAN communication with another DDS Router.

# 8: Set this Discovery Server GuidPrefix to <01.0f.01.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.ca.fe> for WANServer.
# This GuidPrefix is needed in order from a remote DDS Router to connect with this one.

# 9: Add the interfaces where this Participant will listen in WAN.

# 10: Listen in public IP (1.1.1.1) for remote traffic.
# This IP must be set to the public IP of the host where this DDS Router will run.

# 11: Listening port is 11666.
# Remember that if the host is under a NAT, the IP must be the public one and must be forwarded from network
# router to this host to the same port.

# 12: It uses UDP transport by default if not set. Could be set to "udp" or "tcp".

# 13: Add here new addresses where the Participant will listen for remote connections.
