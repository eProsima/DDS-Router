DDS Router on Windows
#####################

.. warning::

    The current version of |ddsrouter| does not have installers for Windows platforms.
    Please refer to the :ref:`developer_manual_installation_sources_windows` section to learn how to build |ddsrouter|
    on Windows from sources.

.. note::

    For a simpler and more streamlined setup, it is highly recommended to use the :ref:`DDS-Router Docker installation <docker>`  or :ref:`Vulcanexus Cloud <vulcanexus>`.
    These methods significantly reduce installation complexity and provide a consistent environment across different platforms,
    making them ideal alternatives to manual buildsâ€”especially on systems like Windows where native support is limited.
