DDS Router Configuration
########################

A |ddsrouter| is configured by a *.yaml* configuration file.
This *.yaml* file contains all the information regarding the |ddsrouter| configuration, such as topics filtering
and :term:`Participants <Participant>` configurations.

Configuration version
=====================

The YAML Configuration support a ``version`` value to identify the configuration version to parse the file.
In future releases could be common to change the YAML format (some key words,
fields, etc.).
This value allow to keep using the same YAML file using an old configuration format, maintaining compatibility
with future releases.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Configuration Versions
        - String in ``version`` tag
        - |ddsrouter| activation release

    *   - version 1.0
        - ``v1.0``
        - *v0.1.0*

    *   - version 2.0
        - ``v2.0``
        - *v0.2.0*

**Current configuration version is ``v2.0``**.
This is the configuration version that is described along this page.

.. note::

    The current default version when tag ``version`` is not set is *v1.0*.

.. warning::

    **Deprecation Warning**.
    In future releases tag ``version`` will be mandatory.

Topic Filtering
===============

.. note::

    The |ddsrouter| topic discovery module is a work in progress.
    Thus, the functionality regarding Topic filtering is still in its early stages.

The |ddsrouter| requires a list of allowed :term:`Topics<Topic>`.
The data transmitted under these topics will be the data relayed by the |ddsrouter|.
The YAML configuration file must contain an ``allowlist`` tag which is a vector (``[]``).
This vector elements contains the Topics that will be forwarded (subsequently the |ddsrouter| creates a
:term:`Writers<DataWriter>` and :term:`Readers<DataReader>` for each topic for each Participant).
Each Topic is determined by its entries ``name``, ``type`` and ``keyed``, with only the first one being mandatory.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Topic entries
        - Data type
        - Default value

    *   - ``name``
        - ``string``
        - \-

    *   - ``type``
        - ``string``
        - ``"*"``

    *   - ``keyed``
        - ``bool``
        - ``false``

The entry ``keyed`` determines whether the corresponding topic is `keyed <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/dds_layer/topic/typeSupport/typeSupport.html#data-types-with-a-key>`_
or not. See :term:`Topic` section for further information about the topic.

.. todo:

    Add link to topic page when created

In the following configuration example, the |ddsrouter| will transmit the topic ``rt/chatter`` (default ROS 2 topic for
``talker`` and ``listener``) with type name ``std_msgs::msg::dds_::String_``.
It also will transmit the topic ``HelloWorldTopic`` (default FastDDS topic for ``HelloWorldExample``)
with type name ``HelloWorld``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    builtin-topics:
      - name: rt/chatter
        type: std_msgs::msg::dds_::String_
      - name: HelloWorldTopic
        type: HelloWorld

.. note::

    Tag ``builtin-topics`` must be at yaml base level (it must not be inside any other tag).


Participant Configuration
=========================

At the yaml base level, along with ``builtin-topics`` tag, there will be the tag ``participants``.
``participants`` handles an array of :term:`Participant` configurations.
Each Participant is identified by a unique :term:`Participant Name` and requires to set the ``kind`` of the Participant.
There could be any number of Participants, and Participant kinds could be repeated.

Each Participant has its specific configuration.
Please, refer to :ref:`user_manual_participant_participant_kinds` in order to see each of the
:term:`Participant Kinds<Participant Kind>` requirements.

.. warning::

    Do not configure two Participants in a way that they can communicate to each other (e.g. two Simple participants
    in the same domain).
    This will lead to an infinite feedback loop between each other.

In the following configuration example, the |ddsrouter| will create two
:ref:`Simple Participants <user_manual_participants_simple>`, one for ``domain 0`` and one for ``domain 1``.
This is a typical use case of :ref:`DDS Domain bridge <examples_change_domain_example>`.
The topics allowed in the two domains will start communicating to each other.
Note that the communication is not P2P performed between the end-user DDS entities,
i.e. the data must reach the |ddsrouter| and this will forward the data.

.. code-block:: yaml

    participants:              # Tag to introduce the participants configurations array

    ################

      - name: Participant0     # Participant Name = Participant0
        kind: local            # Participant Kind = simple
        domain: 0              # DomainId = 0

    ################

      - name: my_custom_part   # Participant Name = my_custom_part
        kind: simple           # Participant Kind = echo
        domain: 1              # DomainId = 1

The first Participant `Participant0` has Participant Name *Participant0* and is configured to be of the *simple*
Participant Kind, and to communicate locally in domain 0.
The second Participant has Participant Name *simple* and it is configured to be of the *simple* kind and to communicate
locally with domain 1.

.. _user_manual_configuration_domain_id:

Domain Id
=========

Tag ``domain`` configures the :term:`Domain Id` of a specific Participant.
Be aware that some Participants (e.g. Discovery Servers) does not need a Domain Id configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

    domain: 101


.. _user_manual_configuration_network_address:

Network Address
===============

Network Addresses are elements that can be configured for specific Participants.
An Address is defined by:

* *IP*: IP of the host (public IP in case of WAN communication).
* *Port*: Port where the Participant is listening.
* *Transport Protocol*: ``UDP`` or ``TCP``.
  If it is not set, it would be chosen by default depending on the Participant Kind.
* *IP version*: ``v4`` or ``v6``.
  If it is not set, it would be chosen depending on the *IP* string format.
* *Domain Name*: Domain unique name to ask DNS server for the related IP.
  This field is ignored if ``ip`` is specified.

.. code-block:: yaml

    ip: 127.0.0.1
    port: 11666
    transport: tcp
    ip-version: v4

    ################

    ip: 2001:4860:4860::8844      # Recognized as IPv6
    port: 1616

    ################

    domain: localhost             # DNS call return value = 127.0.0.1
    port: 33333

.. _user_manual_configuration_discovery_server_guidprefix:

Discovery Server GuidPrefix
===========================

A :term:`Discovery Server` requires a DDS :term:`GuidPrefix` in order to other Participants connect to it.
Under the ``discovery-server-guid`` tag, there are several possibilities for configuring a GuidPrefix.


Discovery Server GuidPrefix by string
-------------------------------------

The GuidPrefix of the Discovery Server can be configured using ``guid`` tag.
Be aware of using the correct format for GuidPrefix.
That is, 12 hexadecimal numbers (lower than ``ff``) separated with ``.``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    discovery-server-guid:
      guid: "1.f.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.ca.fe"       # GuidPrefix = 01.0f.01.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.ca.fe


Discovery Server GuidPrefix by Id
---------------------------------

Using tag ``id``, the GuidPrefix will be calculated arbitrarily using a default |ddsrouter| GuidPrefix.
This default GuidPrefix is ``01.0f.<id>.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.ca.fe``.
Default value for ``id`` is ``0``.
This entry is ignored if ``guid`` is specified.

.. code-block:: yaml

    discovery-server-guid:
      id: 13                                  # GuidPrefix = 01.0f.0d.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.ca.fe

.. note::

    In the current version of the |ddsrouter| only ids in the range 0 to 256 are allowed.
    In future releases it would be implemented to allow a wider range of ids.


ROS Discovery Server GuidPrefix
-------------------------------

There is a specific GuidPrefix for ROS 2 executions, so it could be used using Fast DDS CLI and
ROS 2 ``ROS_DISCOVERY_SERVER`` environment variable
(`<https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/v2.4.1/fastdds/ros2/discovery_server/ros2_discovery_server.html>`__).

The ROS 2 Discovery Server GuidPrefix is set by default to ``44.53.<id>.5f.45.50.52.4f.53.49.4d.41`` where ``<id>``
is the specific id of the Server.
This GuidPrefix also allow an ``id``` value to specify which id is used in the GuidPrefix.
Default value for ``id`` is ``0``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    discovery-server-guid:
      ros-discovery-server: true              # GuidPrefix = 44.53.x.5f.45.50.52.4f.53.49.4d.41
      id: 13                                  # GuidPrefix = 44.53.0d.5f.45.50.52.4f.53.49.4d.41


.. _user_manual_configuration_discovery_server_listening_addresses:

Discovery Server Listening Addresses
====================================

Tag ``listening-addresses`` configures the network addresses where the Discovery Server configured is going to
listen for remote clients or servers.
``listening-addresses`` is *key* for an array of :ref:`Network Addresses <user_manual_configuration_network_address>`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    listening-addresses:
      - ip: 127.0.0.1                # UDP by default
        port: 11667
      - ip: 2001:4860:4860::8844     # Recognized as IPv6
        port: 11668
        transport: tcp


.. _user_manual_configuration_discovery_server_connection_addresses:

Discovery Server Connection Addresses
=====================================

Tag ``connection-addresses`` configure a connection with one or multiple remote Discovery Servers.
``connection-addresses`` is the *key* for an array in which each element has a GuidPrefix referencing the Discovery
Server to connect with; and a tag ``addresses`` configuring the addresses of such Discovery Server.
Each element inside ``addresses`` must follow the configuration for :ref:`user_manual_configuration_network_address`.

.. code-block:: yaml

    connection-addresses:
      - discovery-server-guid:
          guid: 44.53.0d.5f.45.50.52.4f.53.49.4d.41
        addresses:
          - ip: 127.0.0.1
            port: 11666
      - discovery-server-guid:
          id: 4
        addresses:
          - ip: 2001:4860:4860::8888
            port: 11667
            transport: tcp
          - ip: 2001:4860:4860::8844
            port: 11668
            transport: tcp
