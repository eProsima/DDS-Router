WAN Configuration
#################

In order to communicate a |ddsrouter| via :term:`WAN`, some configurations may be required.


NAT Traversal
=============

If the |ddsrouter| is under a :term:`NAT`, a remote |ddsrouter| in a different :term:`LAN` will not be able to
reach it.
Thus, NAT traversal methods will be required.
The most common method that we recommend is configuring the network router so it forwards a specific port from
the internet to a specific host.


Port Forwarding
---------------

This is the easiest way to achieve NAT traversal.
Most network routers support a graphical interface where port forwarding could be easily set.


.. note:

    NAT Traversal communication only affects to IPv4 communication.
    Using IPv6 would not require specific network router configurations (as long as the router supports it).

.. note:

    It is needed to use same public port and internal port due to of Fast DDS configuration requirements.


TCP vs UDP
==========

:term:`TCP` and :term:`UDP` are two well known network transport protocols.
Both have their advantages and disadvantages regarding the scenario.
These are a list of tips to help choosing whether to use one or the other.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Feature
        - UDP
        - TCP

    *   - **Communication** |br|
          **speed**
        - Fast
        - Slower

    *   - **Reliability**
        - No Transport Layer reliability |br|
          (could has DDS reliability)
        - Transport Layer reliability |br|
          (duplicated if DDS reliability is used)

    *   - **Port Forwarding**
        - Require both sides of the communication |br|
          to have ports forwarded from the router.
        - Require only server side of the communication |br|
          to have port forwarded from the router.

.. note::

    DDS is thought to work over UDP and has its own reliability mechanisms.
    Thus, the |ddsrouter| uses UDP transport by default for every address that has not explicitly specified
    a transport in the configuration file.


TLS
---

|eddsrouter| also supports `TLS over TCP <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastdds/transport/tcp/tls.html>`_,
and its configuration can be set per participant for types Local Discovery Server and WAN. Following is a list of the
accepted entries under the ``tls`` tag:

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Tag
        - Requiredness
        - Description

    *   - ``ca``
        - Mandatory for TLS servers and clients
        - Path to the CA (Certification- Authority) file.

    *   - ``password``
        - Optional for TLS servers
        - Password of the ``private_key`` file.

    *   - ``private_key``
        - Mandatory for TLS servers
        - Path to the private key certificate file.

    *   - ``cert``
        - Mandatory for TLS servers
        - Path to the public certificate chain file.

    *   - ``dh_params``
        - Mandatory for TLS servers
        - Path to the Diffie-Hellman parameters file.

.. note::

    Although in principle only required for TLS clients, the CA (Certification- Authority) file must also be provided
    for TLS servers, as they might assume the client role when connecting to other participants configured as servers.


Examples

TCP Port Forwarding Example
---------------------------

Let be the scenario where user *A* host *H*:sub:`A` has a private IP ``192.168.1.2`` given by network router
*R*:sub:`A`, with a public IP ``1.1.1.1``.
Let user *B* with host *H*:sub:`B` has a private IP ``192.168.2.2`` given by network router *R*:sub:`B`,
with a public IP ``2.2.2.2``.
*A* will act as server of the TCP communication, while *B* will act as client.

User *A* should set a port forwarding rule in router *R*:sub:`A` as ``11666 -> 192.168.1.2:11666``.
That is, every datagram that arrives to IP ``1.1.1.1:11666`` will be forwarded to ``192.168.1.2:11666``
(it is required to use the same public port as the internal one).
User *A* should set its *listening-addresses* as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: WANServerParticipant_userA
      kind: wan

      discovery-server-guid:
        id: 2                             # Id to generate the GuidPrefix of the Discovery Server of A
      listening-addresses:
        - ip: 1.1.1.1                     # Public IP of host Ha
          port: 11666                     # Port forwarded router Ra
          transport: tcp                  # Transport protocol

User *B* should set *connection-addresses* to connect to *H*:sub:`A` as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: WANClientParticipant_userB
      kind: wan

      discovery-server-guid:
        id: 3                             # Must be different than A one
      connection-addresses:
        - discovery-server-guid:
            id: 2                         # Id of the Discovery Server of A
          addresses:
            - ip: 1.1.1.1                 # Public IP of Ha
              port: 11666                 # Port forwarded in Ra
              transport: tcp              # Transport protocol

This way, *B* will connect to *A*.
*A* will be able to receive the message because *R*:sub:`A` will forward the message to *H*:sub:`A`.
Once *A* has received the message, a TCP channel will be set, and the communication will travel both ways without
requiring to traverse any other NAT.


UDP Port Forwarding Example
---------------------------

Let be the scenario where user *A* host *H*:sub:`A` has a private IP ``192.168.1.2`` given by network router
*R*:sub:`A`, with a public IP ``1.1.1.1``.
Let user *B* with host *H*:sub:`B` has a private IP ``192.168.2.2`` given by network router *R*:sub:`B`,
with a public IP ``2.2.2.2``.
*A* and *B* will communicate via UDP, so there is no need to set a client and a server.
It does not matter whether *A* knows *B* address, *B* knows *A*, or both know each other.
In this example, *B* will know *A* address, and not the other way around.

User *A* should set a port forwarding rule in router *R*:sub:`A` as ``11666 -> 192.168.1.2:11666``.
That is, every datagram that arrives to IP ``1.1.1.1:11666`` will be forwarded to ``192.168.1.2:11666``
(it is required to use same public port as the internal one).
User *A* should set its *listening-addresses* as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: WANServerParticipant_userA
      kind: wan

      discovery-server-guid:
        id: 2                             # Id to generate the GuidPrefix of the Discovery Server of A
      listening-addresses:
        - ip: 1.1.1.1                     # Public IP of host Ha
          port: 11666                     # Port forwarded router Ra

User *B* should set a port forwarding rule in router *R*:sub:`B` as ``11777 -> 192.168.2.2:11777``.
This is, every datagram that arrives to IP ``2.2.2.2:11777`` will be forwarded to ``192.168.2.2:11777``
(It is necessary to use same public port as the internal one).
User *B* should set its *listening-addresses* and *connection-addresses* as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: WANClientParticipant_userB
      kind: wan

      discovery-server-guid:
        id: 3                             # Must be different than A one
      listening-addresses:
        - ip: 2.2.2.2                     # Public IP of host Hb
          port: 11777                     # Port forwarded router Rb
      connection-addresses:
        - discovery-server-guid:
            id: 2                         # Id of the Discovery Server of A
          addresses:
            - ip: 1.1.1.1                 # Public IP of Ha
              port: 11666                 # Port forwarded in Ra

This way, *B* will connect to *A*.
Once *A* receives the message from *B*, it will communicate with it via address ``2.2.2.2:11777``.
*B* will continue communicating with *A* via address ``1.1.1.1:11666``.


TLS Configuration Example
-------------------------

Below is an example on how to configure a WAN participant as a TLS server and client:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: TLS_Server
      kind: wan

      discovery-server-guid:
        id: 0
      listening-addresses:
        - ip: 1.1.1.1
          port: 11666
          transport: tcp

      tls:
        ca: ca.crt
        password: ddsrouterpass
        private_key: ddsrouter.key
        cert: ddsrouter.crt
        dh_params: dh_params.pem

.. code-block:: yaml

    - name: TLS_Client
      kind: wan

      discovery-server-guid:
        id: 1
      connection-addresses:
        - discovery-server-guid:
            id: 0
          addresses:
            - ip: 1.1.1.1
              port: 11666
              transport: tcp

      tls:
        ca: ca.crt

You may also have a look at ``<path/to/ddsrouter_tool>/share/resources/configurations/security/`` directory, which
contains examples of key and certificate files as well as a script with the commands used to generate them.
