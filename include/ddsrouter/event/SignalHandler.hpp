 * created in a static array, and for every signal that arrives it calls the callback of each object
 * in this array.
 * There could be several Handlers for the same signal, and all the callbacks will be called when
 * the signal arrives.
 *
 * The template \c SigNum references the signal that the object will handle following the
 * values in \c Signals .
 * Be aware that objects for different signals are completely independent as they are different objects
 * that only share the same templatization.
