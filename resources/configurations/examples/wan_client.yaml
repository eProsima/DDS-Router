# CONFIGURATION DESCRIPTION

# With this example, a DDS Router subscribes to every topic in allowlist and transmit this data through
# WAN connection to another DDS Router.
# It will also publish locally the data received from the remote DDS Router.
# Client specifies which DDS Router start the communication with the other, and do not change the behavior of each
# of the routers.

# 1: Allow DDS Topic Name <HelloWorldTopic> with type <HelloWorld>.

# 2: Insert new topics in order to route them.

# 3: New Participant with name <SimpleParticipant>.

# 4: Type of SimpleParticipant: <local>.
# LAN UDP communication with default simple multicast discovery.

# 5: SimpleParticipant will use DDS Domain ID <1>.

# 6: New Participant with name <WANClient>.

# 7: Type of WANClient: <wan>.
# WAN communication with another DDS Router.

# 8: Set the Discovery Server GuidPrefix to <01.0f.02.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.ca.fe> for WANClient.

# 9: Add the addresses where to reach the remote DDS Routers that will connect to.

# 10: Set the Remote Discovery Server GuidPrefix to <44.53.01.5f.45.50.52.4f.53.49.4d.41>.

# 11: Connect to a Discovery Server in IP <1.1.1.1> listening in port 11888.
# This is the same configuration that must be set in the DDS Router that works as a Server in its listening-addresses.
# Add every other address where trying to reach this same remote WAN Discovery Server.

# 12: Add every other WAN Discovery Server connection.

# 13: Add the interfaces where this Participant will listen in WAN.
# This is only needed if Remote WAN Server is using only UDP.

# 14: Listen in public IP (2.2.2.2) for remote traffic.
# This IP must be set to the public IP of the host where this DDS Router will run.

# 15: Listening port is 11670.
# Remember that if the host is under a NAT, the IP must be the public one and must be forwarded from network
# router to this host to the same port.

# 16: It uses UDP transport by default if not set. Could be set to "udp" or "tcp".

# 17: Add here new addresses where the Participant will listen for remote connections.
