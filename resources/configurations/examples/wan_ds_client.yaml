# CONFIGURATION DESCRIPTION

# This configuration example configures a DDS Router to listen to every message published in domain 1 in topics
# HelloWorldTopic (from Fast DDS HelloWorld) and rt/chatter from ROS2 demo_nodes, and to transmit these messages
# through a Discovery Server WAN Participant (configured as Super Client) to another Discovery Server WAN Participant.
# The other direction of communication is also possible; receive messages at the Discovery Server WAN Participant and locally
# publish them in domain 1.
# Client specifies which DDS Router starts the communication with the other, and after communication has been
# established, both routers behave in the same way.

# 0: Use YAML configuration version v5.0

# 1: Allow DDS Topic Name <HelloWorldTopic> with type <HelloWorld>.

# 2: Insert new topics in order to route them.

# 3: New Participant with name <SimpleParticipant>.

# 4: Kind of SimpleParticipant: <local>.
# LAN UDP communication with default simple multicast discovery.

# 5: SimpleParticipant will use DDS Domain ID <1>.

# 6: New Participant with name <WANClient>.

# 7: Kind of WANClient: <wan-discovery-server>.
# WAN communication with another DDS Router via Discovery Server.

# 8: Add the addresses where to reach the remote DDS Routers that will connect to.
# Add as many connection-addresses as needed.

# 9: Connect to a Discovery Server in IP <1.1.1.1> listening in port 11777 over TCP transport.
# This is the same configuration that must be set in the DDS Router that works as a Server in its listening-addresses.
# Add every other address where trying to reach this same remote WAN Discovery Server.
