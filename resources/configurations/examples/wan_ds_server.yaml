# CONFIGURATION DESCRIPTION

# This configuration example configures a DDS Router to listen to every message published in domain 0 in topics
# HelloWorldTopic (from Fast DDS HelloWorld) and rt/chatter from ROS2 demo_nodes, and to transmit these messages
# through a Discovery Server WAN Participant (configured as Server) to another Discovery Server WAN Participant.
# The other direction of communication is also possible; receive messages at the Discovery Server WAN Participant and locally
# publish them in domain 0.
# Server specifies which DDS Router starts the communication with the other, and after communication has been
# established, both routers behave in the same way.

# 0: Use YAML configuration version v4.0

# 1: Allow DDS Topic Name <HelloWorldTopic> with type <HelloWorld>.

# 2: Insert new topics in order to route them.

# 3: New Participant with name <SimpleParticipant>.

# 4: Kind of SimpleParticipant: <local>.
# LAN UDP communication with default simple multicast discovery.

# 5: SimpleParticipant will use DDS Domain ID <0>.

# 6: New Participant with name <WANServer>.

# 7: Kind of WANServer: <wan-discovery-server>.
# WAN communication with another DDS Router via Discovery Server.

# 8: Set this Discovery Server GuidPrefix to <01.0f.01.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.ca.fe> for WANServer.
# This GuidPrefix is needed in order from a remote DDS Router to connect with this one.

# 9: Add the interfaces where this Participant will listen in WAN.
# Add as many listening-addresses as needed.

# 10: Listen in public IP (1.1.1.1) for remote traffic.
# This IP must be set to the public IP of the host where this DDS Router will run.

# 11: Listening port is 11666.
# Remember that if the host is under a NAT, this port is the one that the host will open, but not the one
# used as public in the router.

# 12: External port is 11777.
# This port is used in case the host is under a NAT. This is the public port accessible from any external point
# in the network, and should be forwarded from the network router to the "port" value.

# 13: It uses TCP. UDP transport is used by default if not set. Could be set to "udp" or "tcp".
